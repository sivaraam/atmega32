The following tools are used to build a binary for ATMEGA32:

	* avr-gcc - To compile the program

		Options used to configure the tool:

			-mmcu: specifies the ISA of the target

		Typical command:

			avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega32 -o $OUTPUT_BINARY.out $SOURCE.c


	* objcopy - copy and translate object files, used to generate the
	            Hex file that would be flashed to the target

		Option used to configure the tool:

			-O:  specifies the object format of the output

		Typical command:

			objcopy -O ihex $SOURCE.out $DEST.hex


	* avrdude -  driver program for ``simple'' Atmel AVR MCU (Microcontroller Unit) programmer

		Options to configure the tool:

			-c: specifies the type of the programmer

			-p: specifies the type of the MCU connected to the programmer

			-P: specify the port to which the programmer is attached

			-U: specifies the memory operations to perform

		Typical command:

			avrdude -c avrispmkII -p m32 -P usb -U flash:w:$INPUT.ihex

			Note: Possibly root permission would be required to flash the device.

		Note: A custom version of the 'avrdude' is used to
		program the controller. The reason is currently unknown
		but the binary is present in the 'avrdude' directory.

		The custom config for 'avrdude' is also present in the same directory.
